# DRUGS
A friendly drug database.
Trying to create a user friendlly drug database that is searchable in groups rather than by name only. eg you will type "vaccined" to find all vaccines in database, instead of tDAP, OR vitamins to bring up all vitamins even if the drug name has no "vitamin" in name. Most current databases are searched by names.
